## Purpose

The purpose of the repository is for the development of resources to be used in Computer Science at the middle and high school levels. My initial work is going to be based around Scratch (for middle years) and Python (for high school). Further development will include HTML, Javascript and PHP. Or whatever else springs to mind.
